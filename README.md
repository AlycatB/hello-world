# hello-world
I love computers.
I mean, people are ok, but when you can't sleep at 3am
most people don't appreciate you waking them up. My
computer, on the other hand, gives me a warm "Welcome".
Last year in my programming class, we were asked to
create a pitch for an app. I created a prototype
website... then got bored and turned it into an app...
